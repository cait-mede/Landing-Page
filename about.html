        <br />
        I've always had a passion for helping others. I obtained my B.A. in psychology at Temple University and my M.S.
        in mental health counseling at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. After graduation, I began
        working as a therapist,
        where I walked alongside people while they navigated challenging times in their lives. Through this experience,
        I fine-tuned my communication, empathy, and analytical skills. However, after a few years I found that I was no
        longer fully engaged
        and excited about my future career path.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was seeking a new way to continue improving the lives of others while also channeling my desire for novelty,
        logical reasoning,
        and teamwork. Through my self-exploration and research, I found out about software development as a career. I
        immediately felt drawn in
        by the idea of using my problem-solving skills to build a program. I wanted to see what it was all about, so I
        began teaching myself
        how to code with the use of online resources. After a few months of exploring the possibilities of programming,
        I knew I had found
        the career I wanted to pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was so excited about getting started that I decided to take a risk and apply for a coding bootcamp.
        Due to their impressive reputation and mission to diversify the tech industry, I chose Tech Elevator. Once I was
        accepted, I applied for the
        scholarship they offer, called <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/represent-tech-scholarship"
          target="_blank">Represent Tech</a>. They chose me as the Philadelphia, Spring 2021 Recipient. I couldn't be
        more grateful to receive
        this opportunity as well as all of the knowledge I have accumulated during the program. I can't wait to
        contribute to tech community. Thank you so much for reading!
